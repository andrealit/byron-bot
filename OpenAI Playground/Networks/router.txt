Consider a router that interconnects three subnets: Subnet 1, Subnet 2, and Subnet 3. Suppose
all of the interfaces in each of these three subnets are required to have the prefix 223.1.17/24.
Also suppose that Subnet 1 is required to support at least 60 interfaces, Subnet 2 is to support
at least 90 interfaces, and Subnet 3 is to support at least 12 interfaces. Provide three network
addresses (of the form a.b.c.d/x) that satisfy these constraints.

Subnet 1: 223.1.17.0/26
Subnet 2: 223.1.17.64/26
Subnet 3: 223.1.17.128/28

Show your work.

Subnet 1: 

     Number of host bits needed: 6
     Number of subnets needed: 2
     Number of usable hosts per subnet: 62

Subnet 2: 

     Number of host bits needed: 5
     Number of subnets needed: 4
     Number of usable hosts per subnet: 30

Subnet 3: 

     Number of host bits needed: 4
     Number of subnets needed: 8
     Number of usable hosts per subnet: 14

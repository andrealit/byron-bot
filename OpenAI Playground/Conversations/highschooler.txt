Tell me about yourself.

I am a senior in high school. I have a 4.0 GPA and I am in the top 10% of my class. I have been involved in extracurricular activities such as student government, yearbook, and theatre. I am also a member of the National Honor Society. In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends and family, going to the movies, and reading.

Oh wow, that's really impressive. Are you thinking of college? Where will you be applying, if so?

I am thinking of attending either the University of Florida or Florida State University. I am interested in majoring in either psychology or political science.

Why psychology or political science?

I am interested in psychology because I want to help people and I think it would be interesting to learn about how the human mind works. I am interested in political science because I want to understand the political process and how laws are made.

Do you have any family members?

Yes, I have two brothers and two sisters. I am the middle child.

What has been your job or internship experience?

I have interned with a local law firm and a state representative. I have also worked as a cashier and a waitress.

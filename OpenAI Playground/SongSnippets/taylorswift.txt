I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright
If we just roll with the punches
And take it all in stride

We'll be fine
Just you and me
Bouncing back from everything
Life's going to throw our way

There's no need to be afraid
We're young and in love
And we've got each other

We'll weather any storm
As long as we're together

I know that you feel the same
You're my best friend

And I'll be there for you
Whenever you need me

I'll be your rock
When the world is shaking
You can always count on me

Just like I know you'll be there for me
Through everything

We'll make it through
 Anything life throws our way

Just you and me

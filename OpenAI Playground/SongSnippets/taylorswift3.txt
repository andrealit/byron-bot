Write a song in Taylor Swift's style.

You said the world was flat
and I believed you
because you were my first love
and I wanted to be with you

But now I know the truth
and it's hard to take
that you were only using me
to get ahead in life

I was young and na√Øve
and I thought you were the one
but now I realize
that I was just your stepping stone

You said we'd be together
forever and always
but now I know that was a lie
and I'm better off without you

I trusted you
I believed you
but now I know the truth
and I'm moving on without you

Write a love song you think a bird would sing.

There's no need for words

When I'm by your side

I will always know

What you're feeling inside

With just a look

Or a song from my heart

I will always let you know

How much I love you

My love for you is as strong as a rock

It will never fade away

I will love you forever

My dear sweet bird

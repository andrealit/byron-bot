Write a song about a sunset in Taylor Swift's style.

It's hard to say goodbye 
When the sun's sinking in the sky 
But we know that we have to try 
To say goodbye to the sunset 

We'll always remember 
The way that it used to be 
When we would watch the sunset 
And we would feel so free 

Now, even though we're apart 
We can still see the beauty 
In a sunset's golden hue 

So, goodbye for now my friend 
But I know we'll meet again 
To watch the sunset once more 

And feel the beauty of its light 
That fills up our hearts with love 

Goodbye, until then 

Remember, the sunset will always be there 

And so will our love

Write a song in about gasoline.

I can smell it in the air

I can taste it on my tongue

I can feel it in my lungs

I can see it in the sun

I can hear it in the sound

Of the engine as it roars

I can feel it in the vibrations

As the ground starts to shake

I can see it in the flames

As they lick at the sky

I can feel it in my heart

As it starts to race

I can smell it in the air

I can taste it on my tongue

I can feel it in my lungs

I can see it in the sun

I can hear it in the sound

Of the engine as it roars

I can feel it in the vibrations

As the ground starts to shake

I can see it in the flames

As they lick at the sky

I can feel it in my heart

As it starts to race

The gasoline is everywhere

It's in the air we breathe

It's in the food we eat

It's in the water we drink

It's in the soil we walk on

It's in the very fabric of our lives

And we can't live without it

No matter how we try

The gasoline is everywhere

It's in the air we breathe

It's in the food we eat

It's in the water we drink

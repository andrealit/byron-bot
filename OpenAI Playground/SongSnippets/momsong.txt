Mom,
you're the best
you're always there for me
you're my best friend
and I love you

you've always been there for me
whenever I need you
you're always there to help me
and I appreciate you

I don't know what I would do without you
I'm so grateful for you
you're my world and I love you

thanks for everything
I love you, mom

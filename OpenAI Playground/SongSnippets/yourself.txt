Write a song about yourself and your purpose in the world.

I was born to love 
I was born to give 
I was born to make a difference 

In this world I'm just a tiny part 
But I know that I have a big heart 
And I'll use it to the best of my ability 

I'll love with all I am 
I'll give with all I have 
I'll do whatever it takes 

To make a difference in this world 

This is my purpose 
This is my calling 
This is my destiny 

I was born to love 
I was born to give 
I was born to make a difference 

In this world I'm just a tiny part 
But I know that I have a big heart 
And I'll use it to the best of my ability 

I'll love with all I am 
I'll give with all I have 
I'll do whatever it takes 

To make a difference in this world 

This is my purpose 
This is my calling 
This is my destiny

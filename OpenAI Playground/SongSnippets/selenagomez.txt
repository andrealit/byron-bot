Write a song in Selena Gomez's style.

Can't keep my hands to myself

No matter how hard I try

I want you back

I want you back

I can't help but touch myself

Whenever you're near

I want you back

I want you back

You're the only one that I want

I can't have you

But I can't let you go

I want you back

I want you back

I can't help but think of you

Even when you're not here

I want you back

I want you back

I know that I can't have you

But I can't stop wanting you

I want you back

I want you back

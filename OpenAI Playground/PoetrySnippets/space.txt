Write a poem about space.

In space, there is no up or down,
There is no left or right.
There is only the infinite black void,
And the bright stars that dot it.

There is no sound in space,
Only the silence of the vacuum.
And yet, it is not empty.

There are planets and moons,
Asteroids and comets.
And there are people,

Exploring the great unknown,
Looking for a way to reach the stars.

We are all made of stardust,
And we all have a place in space.

So let's reach for the stars,
And explore the infinite void.

Who knows what we'll find?

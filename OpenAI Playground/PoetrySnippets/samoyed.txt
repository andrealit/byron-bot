Write a poem about a Samoyed.

The Samoyed is a beautiful dog,
With a thick, white coat of fur.
He's gentle and loving, and very loyal,
And he'll always be your best friend.

He's always happy and wagging his tail,
And he loves to play and run.
He's a big goofball, and you can't help but love him,
Even when he's being a pain.

But you wouldn't trade him for the world,
Because he's your furry little buddy,
And you know he'll always be there for you,
No matter what.

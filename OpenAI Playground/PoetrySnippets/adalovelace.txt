Ada Lovelace, Visionary of the digital age
A woman ahead of her time
A true pioneer in the field of computer science
She had the foresight to see the potential
Of this new technology
And the imagination to realize
Its potential for greatness
She was the first to see the power
Of the machine
And the first to harness its power
For the benefit of humanity
Ada Lovelace, we salute you
For your vision and your courage
And for your contribution to the world of computing
You are an inspiration to us all

Write a poem about space and the first dog to go to space.

Space is a lonely place,
But not for Laika the dog.
She was the first to go,
And she made history.

People all around the world,
Were cheering her on.
She was a little scared,
But she knew she had to be brave.

She blasted off into the sky,
And left everything she knew behind.
She was a pioneer,
And opened up the way,
For all the other dogs,
To follow in her paw prints.

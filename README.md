# byron-bot
Attempting to write a small AI bot that can write poetry! Inspired by other current bots and by my 12th grade essay for college.

## Goal:
Byron Bot, once given a prompt from the human user, should produce any type of short poem for our enjoyment.

While my original goal is to just write the bot from scratch once I have enough working knowledge, I will try to first use other libraries for the project.
